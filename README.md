# HolboxAI Package
Welcome to HolboxAI, a comprehensive AI package designed to enhance your data processing and creative capabilities. HolboxAI offers a range of functionalities including text-to-image generation, running textual queries on documents stored in your S3 bucket, and generating insights from natural language queries. This README provides a detailed guide on how to install and use the various features of HolboxAI.
Installation
To get started with HolboxAI, you need to install the package. Run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
pip install holboxai
```

This command installs all the functionalities of HolboxAI, including:
RAG Functionality - Running textual queries on the documents stored in your S3 bucket.
Generating images from text prompts.
Generating insights based on your natural language queries.
After installation, you can import HolboxAI into your project using:
```sh
import holbox as hb
```
## Features
### 1. RAG Functionality
To run textual queries on your S3 bucket documents, follow these steps:
Load Documents from S3 Bucket:
First, import the S3DocReader class and initialize it. Then, call the get_bucket() method and provide the name of your S3 bucket as its argument.
```sh
reader = hb.S3DocReader()
documents = reader.get_bucket("bucket_name")  # Pass the name of your bucket
```
#### Index Documents and Generate Response:
Next, import the DocsQuery class. Use createindexes() to index the documents and query() to generate the response for your prompted query.
```sh
docsQuery = hb.DocsQuery()
indexes = docsQuery.create_index(documents)
query = " "  # Your query here
response = docsQuery.query(indexes, query)
```
#### Validate Sources:
To validate the sources that generated the response of your query, import RelevantDocs and call get_docs(). This will show all the documents from which the response is created.
```sh
rel_docs = hb.RelevantDocs()
docs = rel_docs.get_docs(query, n_docs=4, retriever)
```
### 2. Generating Images from Text Prompts
To generate images based on your text prompts, use the text2image module. The generate_image() method's arguments include your desired prompt, guidance scale, and inference steps.
```sh
txt2img = hb.text2image()
prompt = "a sports car, on a racing track,4K" # Change the prompt according to requirement
txt2img.generate_image(prompt, 5, 25) # example : cfg_scale = 5 , inference_steps = 25 
```

cfg_scale = Guidance scale is a parameter that controls how much the image generation 
            process follows the text prompt. The higher the value, the more the image
            sticks to a given text input and vice-versa. It ranges from (1-20)
             
inference_steps = Inference steps controls how many steps will be taken during this process. 
                  The higher the value, the more steps that are taken to produce the image.
                  It ranges from (5-100) 

### 3. Generating Insights from CSV Files
HolboxAI also allows you to generate visual insights from CSV files. First, import csv_reader from holboxai.informabot, then call read_csv_file() providing the file path as its argument. Lastly, to generate the answer, call get_answer() with your query as the argument.
```sh
import pandas as pd

informabot = hb.CsvQuery()
query = "your query"
df = pd.read_csv("<path>")
response = informabot.single_csv_query(df , query)
print(response)
```
### 4. Getting Sentiment of a text/sentence
To get sentiment of the any text or sentence, import SentimentAnalysis from holboxai.sentiment_analysis. After that we provide two options : 1. OpenAI and 2. AWS Bedrock

1. OpenAI
You need openai api key in order to use this functionality. Once you have that, call get_openai_sentimet() function and pass arguments like your text/sentence and your openai api key.
```sh
sa = hb.SentimentAnalysis()
response = sa.get_openai_sentiment("<Your text>", "<Your openai APi>")
print(response)
```

2. AWS Bedrock
By default model will use amazon.titan-text-express-v1 from amazon bedrock. Call the function get_bedrock_sentiment and pass text/sentence as an argument.
```sh
sa = hb.SentimentAnalysis()
response = sa.get_bedrock_sentiment("<text>")
print(response)
```
